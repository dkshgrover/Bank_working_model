# BankingManagementSystem
This is a basic console project having different portals related to bank activity.
Following Portals are provided in this project:

i-> ADMINISTRATOR portal having functions like adding a new accountant , removing already existing accountant or updating their salary status.

ii-> ACCOUNTANT portal having functions like creating a new bank account , checking details of a customer , deleting an account , etc.

iii-> CUSTOMER portal having functions like checking details of there account , doing transaction related stuff , etc.

Also i have used MySQL for storing all the data and i have stored it all at localhost. I have shared a script file named bank_account.sql which will be present in project. One can copy all queries from that file and paste it at their localhost and they will get all the tables and datbase with different entries formed over there.

This is a demo project only which is based on java and MySQL database. One can run this project on any IDE they like by just starting the main file named Bank_account_main.java.
